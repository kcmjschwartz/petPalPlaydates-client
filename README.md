# Welcome to PetPal Playdates - For people who need a pet fix and pets that need a people fix.

`User Stories`

The Animal Lover:
	As an animal lover that lives in an apartment that doesn’t allow pets, I would like to request a playdate with a pet to give them attention and satisfy my need for interaction with animals.

The Pet Owner:
	As a pet owner, sometimes my pet needs more attention than I can give them so I would like to list my pet for playdates to get the additional attention they deserve.



# How it Works:

1. Users Register for an Account using one of two "Get Started!" Buttons(one in the header and one in the body).  Or they login via the button in the header. Registration and Login are both down through modals
    

2. Users can browse the PetPals that are available for playdates.
3. Users can click on the "Meet {Pet's Name}" button to view more information on the pet in a modal.
4. Users can click on the "Request A PlayDate" button to open a modal to submit their request.
5. Users can view, update, and delete requests they have made in Requests> For My PetPals on the navbar.
6. Pet Owners can add, update, and delete their pets in Pets> My Pets on the navbar.  
7. Pet Owners can view and update the status on requests for playdates with their pets in Requests> For My Pets on the navbar.
8. Admin users have access to view all users, upgrade users to an admin role, and delete users in Admin> Manage Users.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
